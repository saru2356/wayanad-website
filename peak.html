    <p><b>Kurumbalakkotta peak</b></p>
    <p><p>Kurumbalakkotta is a small hamlet in Kalpetta in Wayanad District of Kerala. It has been said that it was the Fort of a Kurumbapaalakan (meaning a king) because it offered a strategic geographical point to keep vigil against the enemies. However, there are no remnants of the fort to be seen. There are also some songs, which describe the relationship of this fort to the reign of the Veda dynasty.

            You can start your trek from Malakara. If you are looking for clear cut paths to the peak, then you are mistaken. Kurumbalakkotta does not have pathways leading to it because it has not yet found a place in the usual trekking manual. You can move on cutting through the long grown theruva grass and yes, watch out for those thorns.</p>
