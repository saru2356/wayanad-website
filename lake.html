    <p><b>Pookode lake</b></p>
    <p><p>Picturesque surroundings and easy access are drawcards that attract large numbers of visitors. The natural fresh water pool is just shy of 9 hectares and nicely perched among hills at a height of 2100 m above sea level.

            The small aquarium by the side may not have enough fish to impress you, nevertheless is good enough to keep the kids hooked.
            
            Have a walk around the lake, get into one of the boats or simply sit and sip a drink. That is all any one feel to do in a location such as this. For extra fun, you can climb on an elephant and tour around or simply wander in the lake side souvenir shacks.
            
            Distances – Kalpetta – 13 kms, Mananthavady – 27 kms  Batheri – 36 kms   Vythiri – 3 kms</p>

    <p><b>Karlad Lake</b></p>
    <p><p>This is uncrowded alternative to Lake Pookode is also a bit modest in the sense that boating and other activities are not available. At the same time, nothing stopping from having a local arrangement and ride the waters in a native canoe, if you dare so.

            Pack some food and have a picnic. That is what this place, unexplored and hence tranquil, is all about. There is even scope for a few restful days here, since there are a few resorts that may suit your needs.
            
            Karlad Lake is a great addition to Banasura Sagar Dama visit, unless you had enough water fun at Banasura. The distance between these two travel attractions is just about 10 kms.
            
            Karlad Lake is located at Thariyode, about a km off from the main road (State Highway 54).
            
            Distances – Kalpetta – 15 kms, Mananthavady – 28 kms  Batheri – 39 kms</p>

    <p><b>Banasura Sagar Lake and Dam</b></p>
    <p><p>Since we touched Karalad, the next is obvious - Banasura.

            Banasura Sagar has perfect reasons to be one of the top tourist spots in Wayanad. The dam is a whopping 1 km in length. That too made of mud and rocks.
            
            This place is a sweet spot of huge hills with a reservoir in the middle. The views are refreshing, to say the least.While paying the entry fee, opt for the jeep ride only if you are busy or have other reasons. A slow walk along the dam is a pleasure, not to be missed.

            Test your speeding skills in the lake. There is room for more adventure as you are already at the base of Banasura hill, one of the majestic trekking spots in Wayanad. Plan in advance because the trek requires permission from Forest Department.
            
            Distances – Kalpetta – 22 kms   Mananthavady – 22 kms   Batheri – 36 kms   Padinjarethara – 45 kms </p>
